# Employee Attrition Prediction
# Project Overview
The Employee Attrition Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model to predict employee attrition (i.e., whether an employee is likely to leave the company) based on various factors such as job satisfaction, performance ratings, tenure, demographics, and more. This project leverages data analytics to assist HR teams in identifying high-risk employees and taking proactive actions to reduce turnover.

# Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Model Building: A variety of machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) are implemented to predict employee attrition.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: Key insights from the data are visualized using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, and an interactive dashboard is created with Tableau to provide actionable insights for HR teams.

Automation: The project includes an automated process for retraining the model based on new employee data to continuously improve predictions.

# Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data Visualization: Tableau

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

Data Sources: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset (available on Kaggle)

# Problem Statement
Employee attrition is a critical challenge faced by many organizations. High employee turnover leads to increased recruitment costs, loss of talent, and disruption in team dynamics. Predicting which employees are likely to leave the company can help HR teams take targeted actions to reduce attrition and improve employee retention.

# Objectives
Predict which employees are likely to leave the company using historical HR data.

Identify the key factors contributing to attrition (e.g., job satisfaction, tenure, performance rating).

Provide HR teams with actionable insights to retain employees and reduce turnover rates.
# Conclusion
Proactive Retention Strategy: The model enables HR teams to identify at-risk employees early, helping them take targeted actions to improve retention and reduce turnover-related costs.

Data-Driven Insights: By analyzing key factors like job satisfaction, tenure, and performance, the project delivers valuable insights into what drives attrition within the organization.

Scalable and Actionable Solution: With predictive modeling in Python and visual dashboards in Tableau, the solution is both scalable and easy for HR leadership to use in making informed, strategic decisions
